    <!-- Notes on my frustrations with Bootstrap vol. 1 -->
    <!-- When trying to use the same code that I maticulously -->
    <!-- setup WITHOUT Bootstrap, I have found that it is more trouble -->
    <!-- than it is worth - because trying to micromanage Bootstrap is a -->
    <!-- fools errand. The style info fights with any conflicts and it is -->
    <!-- almost impossible to know which is overiding which. -->
    <!-- possibly the biggest issue - is that with so many versions of -->
    <!-- Bootstrap, googling code for a module or input box or footer proves -->
    <!-- impossible, because the code will refer to an older version (perhaps) -->
    <!-- and by changing the STYLE tags in the HEAD, you will most likely make  -->
    <!-- code that you already entered useless. I'm not a fan of Bootstrap - unless -->
    <!-- I were to make the most simple site possible in the quickest time possibl -->
    <!-- and that wasn't this exercise. Even though this site was simple. Making it 'like' -->
    <!-- the image in the instructions - even with colors provided - was terribly  -->
    <!-- frustrating with Bootstrap.  -->
